wrapgrep was written for portability and speed and has been tested under both
the latest versions (as of 8/19/2015) of OS X and Ubuntu. Please see the README
file for more application-specific information.

As such, wrapgrep does not have the ability to climb an OS-specific directory
structrure or to color/highlight the output of the pattern match results, as
examples.

However, potential future enhancements (which may or may not be OS-specific)
include:

(1) Walking the directory structure of a given OS rather than using scripts,
batch files, and/or the command "find" wherever these tools are available.

(2) Coloring and/or highlighting the output to distinguish the file name from the
pattern match result as well as emphasize the exact part of a given symbol that
matches the input pattern.

(3) Supporting regular expressions instead of exact substring pattern matches
and/or adding a case-insensitive option.

My apologies for the lack of a make file. Under either OS X or Ubuntu, in a terminal, the command "cc wrapgrep.c -o wrapgrep" will produce a wrapgrep
executable, although depending on how you have your PATH setup, you may need
to run "./wrapgrep <...>" to access the executable file. Please see README
or run "./wrapgrep --help" for more information.
